        <h1>Research Reflection</h1>
        <p>
        For the capstone project, 12M Arts & Design had to design a sustainable livelihood project for Haven for Children, a DSWD institution for children recovering from various forms of abuse. In response to this, the class came up with “Lubela”, a brand of handwoven home decor products. In this project, I was part of the website group, which was responsible for creating the digital branding for the livelihood project. This was the proposed solution to the community’s poor reach, which was the root cause of their lack of funding. It was composed of the following: website, Facebook page, and manuals.

The website team presented their proposal to the administrators of Haven for Children last February 22, 2019. They liked the designs presented to them. However, they were worried that the project could not be executed; this is because it had to be subject to government approval. Since the process for this would take forever, they suggested making the focus of the website solely on Lubela. They also suggested designing a brochure version, which they saw as more feasible. 

When I learned of their input, I was initially saddened. I thought that all the hard work of the website team would go to waste. Thankfully, I was told by my classmates and advisors that this wasn’t the case. Even if they liked it, it wasn’t in their power to approve it. This is why they suggested alternatives to us. I also had to consider their perspective. Despite how modern the world is nowadays, the institution still has an old and conservative mindset; this meant that using technology was quite new to them. This is why they were leaning towards brochures, which they had more experience in handling. 

Because of this project, I learned to be more empathetic. I worked on the digital branding proposal with a tech-savvy mindset, thinking it would be of great use to the institution. However, I failed to consider how difficult the transition would be for them. This happened despite doing user research (e.g. interviews) beforehand. It made me realize that not everything can be accounted for. In future projects, I need to get more insight on the client. If I design from their perspective, I am more likely to see errors. Overall, I am grateful that this research project helps not just Haven for Children, but also 12M.
